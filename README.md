# Fraud Detection System (Machine Learning)

This project implements a machine learning–based fraud detection system designed to identify fraudulent financial transactions using supervised learning techniques.

## Project Overview
The model is trained on historical transaction data and predicts whether a transaction is fraudulent based on engineered financial features. The project focuses on improving fraud detection accuracy while reducing false positives.

## Features
- Transaction-based fraud classification
- Multiple trained model versions for comparison
- Feature engineering for improved detection performance
- Model evaluation using real-world test cases

## Tech Stack
- Python
- pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Data & Models
Due to size and privacy considerations, the following files are not included in this repository:
- Transaction datasets (`*.csv`)
- Trained models (`*.pkl`)

These files are required to run the model locally.

## Notes
This project demonstrates applied machine learning techniques for fraud detection, including feature engineering, model iteration, and evaluation on unseen test cases.# fraud-detection-ml
